# Umbraco 10 Demo Site 

## Get started

- Run website (project: UmbracoTenDemoSite.Web, launchSettings: Umbraco.Web.UI)
- Add admin login and choose database setup.
- In Settings section of the backoffice, select uSync and import all.
- In Settings section rebuild examine indexes.
- Goto Content section and refresh browser or stop debugging and restart. Now the frontend should appear.

- Move connectionString from appsettings.json into user-secrets:
- - Open terminal window for UmbracoTenDemoSite.Web
- - Now set the values for "ConnectionStrings:umbracoDbDSN" and "ConnectionStrings:umbracoDbDSN_ProviderName" accorting to appsettings.json e.g. for sqlite: 
- - - dotnet user-secrets set "ConnectionStrings:umbracoDbDSN" "Data Source=|DataDirectory|/Umbraco.sqlite.db;Cache=Shared;Foreign Keys=True;Pooling=True"
- - - dotnet user-secrets set "ConnectionStrings:umbracoDbDSN_ProviderName" "Microsoft.Data.Sqlite"
- Now you can remove the ConnectionStrings section from appsettings.json or just undo the changes with git.
